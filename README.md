# cat voting app
a brief foray into voting on cat cuteness.

```
yarn
npm start
```

things i wish i could have done
- have a swiper - somehow none of the plugins i used worked. i'm thinking it was a me issue or something to do with the version of react that i'm using
- show the voting history below thumbs up thumbs down or have a history route that shows these things
- have a login screen where the user creates their unique id. this would allow them to go back to that screen when they hand it off to someone else
- show a spinner until the image has loaded fully
- animations
- not commiting my api key
- figure out why the api endpoint when voting throws
